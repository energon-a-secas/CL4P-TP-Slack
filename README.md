CL4P-TP-Slack
========

This new version comes from the history of Enerbot and his companion, a young DevOps. The little bot wanted to sing but the former DevOps in charge couldn't achieve that functionality in the old ways. He must evolve first... and use a lot of modules in the process.

Distribution of files:
---
The first step was to learn from the past and fix the little things. Sadly, the young DevOps couldn't find a good way to that task. Until he remembers, that in fact himself is separated and each one handles a specific function. 

Therefore, his soul that is composed of mind, will, and emotions should fit at some point in the new needs of Enerbot. Maybe.

*TL;DR: Some functions are coupled in modules inside of the following files, don't worry I don't get it either.*

Mind
---------
- Conscious: configures and initialize the Slack Client (RealTime or Web)
- Judgment: redirects and selection of data.
- Memory: define the methods needed for a proper interaction with the MongoDB.
- Mood: the weather of Santiago, Chile will impact the performance.

Senses
---------

- Perception:
- Sight:
 
Will:
---------
- Directive: actions to execute.

And the rest:
---------

voice:
---------

- Voice: defines the client interaction with Slack to post messages.

Actions:
---------

Under the directory of 'actions', the defined actions (ruby scripts) must be included on the core file and include de module of voice.

```
class Directive
  def self.serve(data)
    case data.text
    when /example1/
      # (...)
    when /regex_for_invoke_the_new_script/
      Example.demo(data)
    end
  end
end
```

```
require './voice'

# When there's nothing to say, say something
module Example
  extend Voice
  def self.demo(data)
    text = 'hello is the demo'
    normal_talk(text, data)
  end
end
```
