At first, it aimed to be an imitation of Huemul on Ruby. Still, before we noticed it became a superior being, that would make the first steps to create a solid base for more complex-easy-to-use Chatbots from the experience of trial and error.

I would not recommend using this "model" because it's adapted to work with multiple workspaces simultaneously from a single instance (or worker). We wanted to use the same old folk for handling the same functions and tricks on every space.

We keep it as our friend and add new features every once in a while.
